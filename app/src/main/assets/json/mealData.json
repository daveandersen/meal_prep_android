        "ingredients": "1 tbsp curry paste, 1 tbsp mango chutney, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1 serving salt (to taste), 50 ml olive oil, 4 chicken breasts, 300 g couscous, 350 ml vegetable stock",
        "directions": "To make a marinade for your chicken, add the curry paste, chutney, turmeric, salt and olive oil to a bowl and mix it well. Cut each chicken breast in half before adding to the marinade. Stir well until all of the chicken is covered. Leave the chicken aside for at least 20 minutes — ideally in the fridge overnight. Heat a grill pan over medium heat and lay out your chicken pieces. Grill the chicken pieces for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until golden and slightly charred. Meanwhile, place the couscous in a big bowl and carefully pour in the boiling vegetable stock. Cover the bowl with a lid and leave to the couscous to soak for around 5 minutes. Fluff your couscous with a fork and add any extras you want. Pomegranate seeds are great for a colour and flavour. Divide your couscous into 4 containers before topping with two pieces of marinated chicken. Finish the dish with a sprinkle of coriander.",

Let cook until the fruit is a thick and jammy consistency, about 8 to 10 minutes (some fruit may need longer). Stir often so that the fruit does not burn. Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla extract, then let cool to room temperature. In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir together the Greek yogurt, milk and 1 tablespoon of honey. Taste and add additional honey a little at a time until you reach your desired sweetness. Place the granola in a small bowl, then mix it with 1/4 cup of the prepared yogurt mixture. This coats the granola and will help it soften and freeze into the popsicles. Arrange a popsicle mold on your work surface. With a small spoon, place a generous dollop of yogurt into the bottom of each. Next, add a small scoop of granola, then a spoonful of the cooked fruit, lightly tapping the mold on the counter between layers to remove any air pockets. Continue layering the yogurt, granola, and fruit until the molds are filled. Tap the molds on the counter once more, then insert the popsicle stick. Freeze until solid, 6 hours or overnight. To unmold the yogurt popsicles, run the mold under hot water for a few seconds (the time needed will vary based upon the temperature of your freezer). Gently remove and enjoy!",
